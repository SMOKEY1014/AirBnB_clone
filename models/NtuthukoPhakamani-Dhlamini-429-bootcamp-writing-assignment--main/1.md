My name is Ntuthuko Dhlamini, friends call me Smokey, and not because I’m smoking but my when my biological name is shortened (Ntuthu), its English translation is ‘Smoke’, so that’s how I got my name Smokey. I was born in a small town in the Province of KZN called Ulundi, where I grew up with my mother and 2 siblings, and I’m the middle one between two sisters. 
When I had to proceed to 6th Grade, I moved to Newcastle Madadeni township. That’s where my life actually started. I came to realize that I love technology. I loved gaming, liked to try understanding smart devices and asked a lot of questions. I even liked watching movies where tech was involved such as hacking, automation, and robotics which we now call AI.
I started  my journey in the world of programming as a beginner at my high school where we were being taught basic HTML and Microsoft office apps on a subject called Computer Applications Technology, it didn’t really rely on programming but more of Computer awareness and know how to use it. I nailed most of my assignments and tests on that subject.
Then went to tertiary called Durban University of Technology where I did my Diploma of ICT in Applications Development. Created a residence system which had multiple users, admin, students and drivers, we were using C# and MVC. Our App got recognized and the institution implemented some ideas and functionalities that were on that App, Biggest achievement in my life.
