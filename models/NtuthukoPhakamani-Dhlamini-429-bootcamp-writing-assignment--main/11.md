Cheating is not good, If you copy someone’s else work, you’re actually cheating yourself, 
you’re limiting yourself from enriching your own brain. Also, at the end of the day, you will be caught. 
It’s no use to have a useless, pointless qualification when yourself is not equipped enough for the qualification. 
Your qualification can get you a job, but your skills will keep the job.

Taking time to fully understand concepts is a good idea, the aim to get the skill and master it, 
qualification is useless without the proven skill. I’m the proof of that, 
I am qualified but here I am starting afresh, strengthening my skills until I get a good job. 
But that does not mean I copied, I don’t have enough proof of my skills, that’s why I’m saving every little/big project is do now.
