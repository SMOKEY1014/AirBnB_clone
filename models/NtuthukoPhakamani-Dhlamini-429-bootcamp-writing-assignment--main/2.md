At the end of my final year I got a job at a dealership company in my hometown called Audi Centre Newcastle, 
and I’m grateful for the Job, I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for it, But I want a more Technical career for myself, 
which is why  I using my salary to enrol on online courses and bootcamps 
I can't find a job related to my qualification because I don’t have proof of my skills. 
So I decided to start afresh, learn and save every project I do to serve as proof of my skills. 
I enrolled to Umuzi bootcamp to sharpen my Development skills, get more knowledge and become a valuable in the market of Tech space. 
My  wish in this career is to have an academy that educates programming in rural Areas. When you live in rural areas, 
you’re likely to dream less because there’s not exposure of the amazing careers the world has to offer. Also, I want to become an inventor, 
become one of the best developers in tech industry, bring ideas and innovations to life and become a vessel of knowledge when it comes to Software Engineering or Web Development. 
Software Engineering/Development in my starting place, my final Place is to be involved in creation of AI, Automation and Robotics. 
I believe we’re capable of bringing what people call the future in sci-fi movies, into our present generation.
