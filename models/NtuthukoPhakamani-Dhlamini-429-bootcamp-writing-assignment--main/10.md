Financially I’m investing in my studies, I want to equip myself as much as I can. 
I do have a job, but it doesn’t limit me to focus on education, actually it helps me get away from home, 
my focus is better when I’m away from my family, also it helps me pay for my education. 
So I’m committed to education, both financially and with my time.
