1.	Firstly I would like to build a basic house for my family.
2.	Pay off my debts and Moms debts.
3.	Buy a simple affordable car for easy access of things.
4.	Start a business that will generate income for my family so they wonâ€™t have to rely on my income.
5.	Now I serve my inner self, build or buy a dream house and a cool car.
6.	Start my own family and get married. Expand the business so it can feed my new family and the rest of the community.
7.	Then Quit so the next person can have a chance like I did. Start my own Tech Company, that will stay relevant and operational for generations to come. create a legacy.
