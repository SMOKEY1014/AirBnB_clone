Yes I do have experience, I do have a qualification in Applications Development / Software Engineering.
I have created projects before, C# MVC Projects, and Other HTML, CSS, and Javascript Projects, all found in my Github.
The Languages I likely use  are C# (but not I'm confident enough with it so I'm still teaching myself again so I can create more MVC projects), C, Python and JavaScript (I am familiar with HTML/CSS as well).
Version Control I use is Git.
My current project involves developing a fullstack web application called AirBnB clone.
