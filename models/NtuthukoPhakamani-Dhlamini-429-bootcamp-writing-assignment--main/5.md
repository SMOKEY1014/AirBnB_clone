What makes you think you have what it takes? What traits or 
attributes do you have that will be useful in this setting? Maybe it’s past experience? Maybe you have an IQ of 203.
 Maybe you are good at asking questions. Maybe you just don’t give up.

 I have a very special interest  in the field of Technologyhology, and it started long ago.
 I don have an experience in programming and I like the feeling of accomplishment I get when my code runs as expected.
 I am good with breaking down big problems into smaller fixable components. And yes, I never give up, I take breaks only.
