I devided my day into 4 hours intervals, starting from 8 AM. I do what is requied by my job from 7:30 AM, and during breaks I take from studying.
First 4 hours goes to Umuzi Bootcamp.
Second 4 hours goes to Zaio Bootcamp.
By this time I'm likely to clock out of work and go home, then spend another 4 hours at home Doing tasks from ALX software Engineering

Then sleep for ~ 8 Hours, the other 4 hours is used during the day for going and coming back from works, do house chores. My 24 hrs cycle has been complete.

And Yes, I just love this stuff, or because I want to get a job sooner.
