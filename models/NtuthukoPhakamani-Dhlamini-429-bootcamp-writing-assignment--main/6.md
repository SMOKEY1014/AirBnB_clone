What might get in the way of your success?

The only thing that is keeping me from being focused to the maximum of my capabilities is time and environment.
I'm employed and I have to do what my job requires first then  I can pursue other interests, right now which is this bootcamp.
Also the area I'm based at has bad newtork strength especially during loadshedding, that inteferes with my progess a lot. 
my wish is to get a similar/better job I have right now so i can pay for my other studies, be based in a strong/fast network strength area and maximize my focus on education.
