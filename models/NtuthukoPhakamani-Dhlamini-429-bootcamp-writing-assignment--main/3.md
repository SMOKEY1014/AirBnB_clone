How do you spend your free time? 
You can just give us a list of things you like to do. Some people like to exercise, watch movies, readâ€¦ what do you like to do?

I'm less likely to have free time as I'm enrolled into multiple bootcamps.
but when I find time, I go to internet and watch Technical stuff, Innovatons, just keeping tabs with tech.
Sometime I like to play games such as Cards, Chess, and Video Games, but that rarely happens for the past 2 years.
For now, My day is devided, Morning for work (07:30 AM - 5 PM) and during this time I likely to try to finish my daily tasks related to school work
because my job is not that busy. So I spend 4 hours for Zaio Bootcamp, 4 hours for Umuzi Bootcamp,then I go home, and spend 3 hours for my Software Engineering course which I'm about to complete in 3 months
