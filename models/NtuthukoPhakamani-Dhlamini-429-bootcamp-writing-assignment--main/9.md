I will keep trying, start a small business like a fast-food shop or gaming centre for the kids.
As my business grows, I expand my gaming centre to a programming academy, grow to be a tech company which 
innovates and invents new solutions. The end goal is to have a Tech company like tesla, full of Computer Scientists 
and Engineers providing valuable solutions to out Government, whether itâ€™s a solution which integrates Technology and 
Medical Health, or Technology and Military, or Technology and Energy. I see a lot of opportunities which needs some tech in it. 
At the end, everything must be automated, and maintained.
